Gaggle.net's Core Values
Before we get to the technical requirements of the job, let's make sure Gaggle is an environment you're going to enjoy and be successful. We have a number of core values that we use to guide how we work together, and how we grow as a company. These aren't motivational poster gimmicks. They're recurring themes that have worked for us as we've grown as a company and we keep them in our minds during those times when we tackle the big challenges:

Innovation over Perfection - We've always been a company that has pushed hard to come up with new solutions to problems even at the risk of getting it wrong. We make mistakes, but that's ok. Our drive to innovation is a strength of Gaggle, but it also leads to some real challenges and even outright problems. We need to know and understand this about ourselves; celebrate it and at times compensate for it.


Hire Exceptional People (and let them do their job) - Working with great people is a powerful motivator. It makes us better when we are challenged by great coworkers. On the other hand, working with someone who doesn't carry their weight drags everyone down. Let's never settle!


Work Hard; Make it Better - If you see something that is not right, roll up your sleeves and pitch in to find a solution.

This job post has expired (either the position was filled or the post is no longer listed). You are viewing an archived version.,"77 million Americans work for an hourly wage. Their median income is $34,142. They don’t make a lot of money—and worse, their income and expenses are inconsistent. As a result, they frequently don’t have enough income to cover expenses, so these Americans spend $100 billion every year just to make ends meet. They lose 10-30% of their income to things like payday loans, overdraft fees, and late bill fees. It is expensive to be poor.
You want to fix that. At Even, you’ll be using data to help Americans get out of debt faster, build liquid assets sooner, and increase the efficiency of every dollar they earn. You will help us quantify the impact our product has on the American workforce. And you’ll work in an organization that views data science as central to everything we do, because it’s how we know if we’re truly succeeding at solving the problem.
You'll:

Build our ability to quantify what our users are doing: what they’re spending their money on, when and why they’re spending, and what they’re doing when they’re using the Even app
Develop hypotheses for how we might influence those things, and work with our engineering team to test your hypotheses
Collaborate with our engineers on our internal APIs to ensure you spend less time fixing the way you get data, and more time understanding the data
Work with our credit team to feed your understanding into our credit models
Own our ability to disseminate what you've learned. This could include things like dashboards, data workshops, annual reports, etc.

To succeed, you'll need:

Strong statistics and/or mathematics fundamentals. You don’t need a formal degree, but you must speak the language of data.
Intellectual honesty. Your job is to discover the truth, not ""validate"" your preconceptions.
The technical ability to build your own models and ingest data from our APIs. Python is probably the best tool for this job, but we don't care what technology you use so long as it doesn't limit you.

I’m interested! Tell me more about the curriculum
We currently have two Data Science workshops, one based in R and the other in Python.

Our R-based workshop, Foundations of Data Science, is targeted to students with little or no programming background, who want to get a taste of data science
Our Python-based workshop, Data Science Intensive, is meant for students with some programming experience and statistics background, who want to transition to data science

In both cases, our curriculum is curated by experts to include the best materials in the field: think of us as a college professor who includes book chapters, videos and other material to create the best learning experience.
Excellent! What about the students?
Our students are working professionals and college/graduate students from all over the world, interested in getting started with data science.

Fast forward one year:
You predicted the future, made us money, and made our CEO happy. Good year!
You built predictive capacity models to predict how every new WeWork building should be optimized to get the best utilization. This made our CEO, CFO, architects, and members extremely happy. Thanks to you, we can also now predict the success of our business in new markets and locations—all due to your data models.
You also helped us prioritize our product roadmap by building a quantitative model that takes quantitative user research data and predicts what will benefit the business the most. We couldn’t be happier!
You know what, we could! Once we identified issues in small sample qualitative studies, you found out if these applied to the broader member population, and transformed data into a dollar figure to compare the money wasted or saved from addressing user experience issues.
Not only that, you also created, collected, and analyzed weekly member engagement metrics, to reflect how WeWork is delivering services. Your reports and presentations are giving our executive team constant feedback on where things are going well, and what we can improve.
As one of the first few team members of WeWork UX, we thank you for your dedication and hard work. We look forward to the next four years!

WeWork UX is a brand new group to create a holistic experience for WeWork members worldwide through physical spaces, digital products, and service design.

If you are an experienced data scientist, and would love to be part of a new approach to physical, digital, and service design, you should strongly consider applying to this position. We promised great data challenges!
You will work in our New York City headquarters. We’ll provide the resources you need to bring out the best in your talents and skills.

You are a passionate data scientist with an excellent background in statistics, you’re well versed in Python and machine learning, and thrive on resolving complex problems with elegant, computationally efficient solutions. You’re able to work closely with a cloud engineer, product manager, and advisors, but also able to work independently. You’re interested in human psychology, and in what truly motivates individual differences in behavior in the digital world and beyond. If this is you, then this is an opportunity you can’t miss:
AMS Psychographics has a Data Analytics Engine that optimizes psychographic audiences for high-value ad targeting. Our first objective is to reshape the multi-billion-dollar political advertising industry. By inventing a new class of science-based psychographic data and building a cloud platform that integrates with existing ad platforms, audiences for political ads can be targeted with greater than five times the efficiency of conventional methods. Beyond its game-changing potential in the US 2016 elections, our engine is the only technology of its kind that is extensible to international markets. Other applications include ad targeting in high-value consumer verticals, and predicting world events driven by public opinion with much greater accuracy than today’s methods. The company will leverage its simple licensing model to generate more than $110M in revenue in less than five years.
The company was founded by Dr. Avi Tuschman, an internationally recognized expert on the emerging science of human political orientation (see OurPoliticalNature.com and WhyTheDivide.com). AMS’s algorithms leverage advanced psychometric modeling as well as recent innovations in big-data statistics. No other product on the market has a scientific way to measure or model political orientation.
AMS has attracted world-class talent in psychographic profiling, the business of political technology, and ad tech. AMS has two key data partnerships, is commercially engaged with the third-largest publisher ad network, and has secured $140k in verbal ad-testing commitments from seven media agencies.
