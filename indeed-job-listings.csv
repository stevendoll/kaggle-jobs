"Sensor technology, the Internet of Things, and Big Data analytics are some of the hottest areas in tech right now. At Select Source Solutions we offer you the ability to work on ALL of these, with three critical differentiators. First, you get to work with a fantastic tech stack. Second, you get to use this technology to solve very interesting, real-world problems. Third, you get to see some of the largest companies in the world use your solutions everydayâon billions of dollars of âthingsââto realize millions of dollars of value.


Select Source Solutions is hiring experienced engineers excited by the prospect of using streaming analytics and machine learning to enable our customers to change their entire operations of their enterprises using insights and predictions from sensor and IoT data. We are looking for engineers with experience in analytics and machine learning as well as engineers capable of working with streaming analytics and complex event processing. We have created a DAG-based architecture using Kafka, Spark, Hadoop, Cassandra and Solr that combines data ingestion, transformation, finite state processing, aggregation, indexing, and immutable storage to essentially create a Google-like infrastructure for sensor data (imagine building the equivalent of Google Analytics and IFTTT for the industrial IoT). We tackle fun challenges like ingestion of data in real-timeâwith any need of an APIâand self-healing, exactly-once processing at thousands of transactions per node per second (we recently converted from Storm and MapReduce to Spark--Streaming and batch.)


We work in small, multi-disciplined teams of product managers, hardware engineers, data engineers, data scientists, application engineers, and devops professionals. You will see your work in production in days or weeksânot months. You will get the opportunity and flexibility to explore a wide range of technologies and challenges (you can expand into work in everything from front end tech to data engineering to firmware programming).


If you believe âitâs all about the dataâ and are excited by the combination of a âcan doâ startup culture and the customer base and financials of an established company, and want to use the Internet of Things to build solutions to tackle big real-world challenges, then Select Source Solutions is right for you.


Qualifications:

BS/BA in computer science, computer engineering, or related degree
5+ years experience developing large-scale, distributed data platforms and data processing solutions for PaaS / DaaS platforms, Internet-scale companies, government agencies, etc.
Experience working in an agile development environment
You should also have significant experience in several of the following areas:

Data ingestion using distributed queuing technologies such as RabbitMQ, AMQP, Kafka, or ZeroMQ,
Streaming analytics and complex event processing using Storm, Spark, IBM InfoStreams, or similar technologies
Proven experience using MapReduce, Spark, other ETL/ELT technologies to process TBs of data daily, across hundreds (or even thousands) of continuously running jobs
Deep understanding of how to design high-performant data models for multiple NoSQL data stores (file stores, wide column databases, key-value stores, etc.)
Hands-on experience with Hive, Impala, Presto, and similar tools for SQL-like exploration of large-scale data sets
Even better, you also:

Enjoy designing interactive analytics solutions
Are comfortable with the flexibility of high-agile environments
Prefer using Continuous Integration and Deployment to reduce manual work
Are interested blurring the line between Software Engineering & Data Science
Have experience in geospatial processing at scale
